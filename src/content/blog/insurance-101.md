## Life Insurance

Life Insurance is a contract between an individual and an insurer, where the insurer pays a lump sum (death benefit) to beneficiaries upon the insured’s death, in exchange for regular premium payments.

### Need for Life Insurance

- **Income Replacement**: Supports dependents financially.
- **Debt Protection**: Pays off outstanding loans.
- **Final Expenses**: Covers funeral and medical costs.
- **Education**: Secures children’s future education.
- **Estate Planning**: Manages taxes and wealth transfer.
- **Business Protection**: Ensures business continuity.
- **Peace of Mind**: Guarantees financial security for loved ones.

### Types of Life Insurance

| Type of Life Insurance      | Purpose                                   | Key Differences                                  |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|

| Variable Life Insurance     | Lifetime coverage with investments        | Cash value linked to market performance, higher risk. |

|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|

### Term Life Insurance: Key Factors

#### Coverage Period
- Fixed duration (10-30 years).
- No payout if the policyholder outlives the term.
- Choose term length based on specific needs (e.g., until mortgage is paid off or children graduate).

#### Premium Structure
- Lower than permanent life insurance.
- Two premium options:
  - **Level premium**: Stays fixed throughout the term.
  - **Increasing premium**: Starts lower but increases over time.
- Rates depend on:
  - Age.
  - Health condition.
  - Coverage amount.
  - Term length.

#### Death Benefit
- Guaranteed lump sum payment to beneficiaries.
- Paid only if death occurs during the policy term.
- Tax-free benefit to beneficiaries.
- Can be used for:
  - Living expenses.
  - Debt repayment.
  - Education costs.
  - Final expenses.

#### Renewability & Conversion Options
- **Renewability**: Option to extend coverage without a new medical exam.
  - Usually comes with higher premiums.
  - Valuable if health deteriorates.
- **Conversion**: Option to convert to permanent insurance.
  - No medical exam required.
  - Must convert within a specified timeframe.
  - Useful for changing insurance needs.

#### No Cash Value Component
- Pure death benefit protection.
- No savings or investment component.
- No surrender value if canceled.

#### Affordability Factors

#### Example Scenarios

1. **New Parents**
   - 30-year term to cover children through college.
   - Coverage amount based on income replacement needs.
2. **Homeowners**
   - 15 or 30-year term matching mortgage length.
   - Coverage amount equal to mortgage balance.
3. **Business Owners**
   - Term length matching business loans.
