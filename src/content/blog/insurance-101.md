#### What is Insurance?
> Insurance is a risk management tool that involves a contract, often referred to as a policy, where an individual or entity pays a premium to an insurer in exchange for financial protection or reimbursement against specified losses. 
> 
> It originated in ancient times, with evidence of early systems of insurance traced back to Babylonian, Chinese, and Indian traders who used methods to distribute risk during their ventures. Modern insurance developed in the 17th century, particularly with the establishment of marine insurance in England to protect merchants and shipowners.
